# Secrets Project

Welcome to the Secrets project! This application prioritizes security and implements various layers of protection to secure sensitive user data and interactions.

## Security Levels Implemented

### 1. Username and Password

- **Description:** Utilizes robust password policies and secure authentication mechanisms for user login.
- **Implementation:** Uses encryption protocols and strong password hashing to protect user credentials.

### 2. Database Encryption

- **Description:** Protects sensitive data stored in the database using encryption techniques.
- **Implementation:** Utilizes industry-standard encryption methods to secure user information within the database.

### 3. Hashing

- **Description:** Implements hashing algorithms to convert sensitive data into unique hash values.
- **Implementation:** Ensures that plain text data, especially passwords, is not stored directly; instead, hashes are stored for added security.

### 4. Salting and Hashing

- **Description:** Strengthens password security by combining salting with hashing techniques.
- **Implementation:** Adds random salts to passwords before hashing, significantly enhancing resistance against brute force attacks.

### 5. Cookies and Sessions

- **Description:** Manages user sessions securely using cookies.
- **Implementation:** Ensures data integrity and minimizes vulnerabilities related to session handling for a more secure user experience.

### 6. OAuth 2.0 Google Sign-In

- **Description:** Implements OAuth 2.0 for secure and convenient authentication via Google Sign-In.
- **Implementation:** Adheres to best practices for third-party authentication, providing a reliable and secure login option.
